# html-tokenizer

A simple HTML lexer implementation, written in Java. 

Uses its own data structures to implement the parser, see [data-structures](./data-structures) for more information.

Does not support all HTML features, but should be able to parse most HTML documents.

Input an HTML file, and the lexer will output a list of tokens and the count of each.
